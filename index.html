        <p>The web development journey has been stressful and fun as well. I was introduced to a site called free code camp which has been very useful to me. It gave me a guide on how to build websites and other web programming tasks.
            And after executing various projects on the site, i decided to host one of them on a free hosting site called github.And from there i started moving on as an upcoming web developer 
            I continued carrying out projects on the site to build on my knowledge in web development. I was able to accumulate 2000 points on the site upon my hardwork which seem quite encouraging. My aim is to carry out all the project on the site and begin to build my personal projects. And i'm working tiredlessly towards that
